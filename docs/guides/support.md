# General Support Statement

This Terraform AWS ZPA App Connector Module is supported and maintained by the Zscaler Technology Alliances team in partnership with our global support team.

## Support Ticket Severity

Support tickets related to the Terraform Modules can be opened with [Zscaler Support](https://help.zscaler.com/login-tickets), however since the provider is just a client of the underlying product API, we will **NOT** be able to treat terraform module related support requests as a Severity-1 (Immediate time frame).

When reporting bugs, please provide the Terraform script that demonstrates the bug and the command output. Stack traces will also be helpful.

Notice that we will **NOT**, however, fix bugs upon customer demand, as we have to prioritize all pending bugs and features, as part of the product's backlog and release cycles.

If you have an urgent escalation, please contact your local Zscaler account team (RSM/SE/CSM/TAM) for assistance.
